        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What makes athlete wealth management different from regular wealth management?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Professional athletes face a financial reality that most people never encounter: the majority of your lifetime earnings arrive in a compressed window of 3-10 years, often starting in your early 20s. Combine that with multi-state tax obligations in every city you compete, intense public visibility, pressure from family and associates, career-ending injury risk, and the need to plan for 50+ years of post-career life — and it's clear that a standard advisory approach doesn't work.</p>
            <p>We've built every aspect of our practice around these realities. From how we construct portfolios to how we schedule reviews around your season, everything is designed for the way athletes actually live and earn.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What is a fiduciary, and why does it matter?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A fiduciary is legally and ethically obligated to act in your best interest — not their own. This is a higher standard than what most financial professionals are held to. Many brokers and advisors operate under a "suitability" standard, meaning they only need to recommend products that are "suitable" for you — even if those products pay them higher commissions.</p>
            <p>We are a fee-only fiduciary. We don't sell products, earn commissions, or receive kickbacks. Our compensation comes directly from advisory fees that you agree to in advance. When we recommend a strategy, it's because we believe it's the best option for you — period.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How do your fees work?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We charge a transparent advisory fee based on the assets we manage for you. There are no hidden costs, no transaction fees, no commissions, and no performance-based charges. You'll know exactly what you're paying before we begin, and the fee structure is outlined clearly in our advisory agreement.</p>
            <p>We believe our interests should be aligned with yours — when your portfolio grows, we both benefit. That's the way it should work.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">When should I start working with a wealth advisor?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The earlier, the better. Ideally, the best time to engage a wealth advisor is before you sign your first major contract — or even during your NIL stage in college. The financial decisions you make in the first year of significant earnings can set the trajectory for decades.</p>
            <p>That said, it's never too late. Whether you're mid-career, approaching retirement, or already retired, we can help you assess where you stand and build a plan from there.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need to be in Portland to work with you?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Not at all. While our team is based in the Portland metro area (Lake Oswego, Oregon), we serve athletes across the country. We conduct meetings via video call, phone, and in person when schedules allow. Many of our clients are traveling during the season, and we're built to work around your schedule — not the other way around.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What is the minimum to work with Exceptional Wealth Group?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We work with athletes at various stages of their careers and don't publish a strict asset minimum. If you're a professional athlete — whether you're a first-round pick or a practice squad player — we're happy to have a conversation about how we can help. Our goal is to build relationships that last an entire career and beyond.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Category: Taxes -->
      <div class="faq-category" id="faq-taxes-planning">
        <h2 class="faq-category-title">Taxes &amp; Financial Planning</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How do multi-state taxes work for professional athletes?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Most states (and some cities) require professional athletes to pay income tax on the portion of their salary earned while working in that jurisdiction. This is commonly called the "jock tax." If you play 16 regular-season games, each game represents a portion of your income — and the state where that game is played may claim a share.</p>
            <p>It gets more complex when you factor in preseason games, training camp, endorsement income tied to specific locations, and differences in how each state calculates "duty days." Without proactive planning, athletes often overpay significantly. We work with specialized CPAs to ensure your tax strategy accounts for every jurisdiction and maximizes every available credit and deduction.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What is NIL financial planning?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>NIL stands for Name, Image, and Likeness — the right of college athletes to earn money from their personal brand while still maintaining NCAA eligibility. Since NIL rules were adopted, college athletes can earn from endorsements, social media, appearances, merchandise, and more.</p>
            <p>NIL income is taxable, and many student-athletes aren't prepared for that reality. We help college athletes understand their tax obligations, structure their NIL income properly, evaluate deals before signing, and establish good financial habits early — long before they go pro.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Can you help with my taxes directly, or do I need a separate CPA?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We provide comprehensive tax planning and strategy as part of our wealth management services. For tax preparation and filing — especially the multi-state returns that athletes require — we coordinate closely with CPAs who specialize in athlete taxation. Think of us as the quarterback who calls the plays: we design the tax strategy and ensure your CPA, attorney, and other professionals are all executing from the same playbook.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Category: Investments -->
      <div class="faq-category" id="faq-investments-risk">
        <h2 class="faq-category-title">Investments &amp; Risk</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What is your investment approach?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We follow a disciplined, value-oriented investment philosophy. Our team identifies opportunities where market prices don't reflect an asset's true worth — whether a company is undervalued due to temporary challenges or overvalued due to unsustainable hype. Buying at attractive valuations tends to both increase upside potential and reduce downside risk.</p>
            <p>We build diversified portfolios across public equities, fixed income, and selectively, alternative investments. Every portfolio is customized to your timeline, risk tolerance, and tax situation. We don't chase trends, and we don't put your money into anything we wouldn't invest in ourselves.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How do you protect against the risk of career-ending injury?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Injury risk is one of the most significant financial threats athletes face. We address this through a multi-layered approach: disability insurance that covers loss of income, loss-of-value insurance for contract negotiations, life insurance for family protection, and — most importantly — a financial plan that doesn't assume your career will last as long as you hope.</p>
            <p>We stress-test every plan against early-retirement scenarios so that even if your career is cut short, your financial foundation remains strong.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">People are always bringing me business deals and investment opportunities. Can you help evaluate them?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Absolutely — and this is one of the most important things we do. Athletes are frequently approached with investment pitches, startup opportunities, real estate deals, restaurant ventures, and endorsement offers. Some are legitimate. Many are not.</p>
            <p>We provide independent due diligence on any opportunity brought to you. We examine the financials, the legal structure, the people involved, and whether the deal makes sense within your overall wealth plan. Having a trusted, objective advisor who can say "this doesn't add up" has saved countless athletes from losing significant money.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How do I know if my current financial advisor is doing a good job?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Ask yourself a few questions: Can you clearly explain your own financial plan? Do you know exactly what fees you're paying? Has your advisor proactively reached out to discuss tax planning, estate updates, or insurance reviews? Do you have visibility into every account and holding? Are they a fiduciary?</p>
            <p>If the answer to any of those is "no" or "I'm not sure," it may be worth a second opinion. We offer confidential portfolio reviews for athletes who want an independent assessment of their current situation — no obligation to switch.</p>
